## Welcome!
Welcome to the Interstella Galactic Trading Company team! Interstella GTC is an intergalactic trading company that deals in rare resources. Business is booming, but we're struggling to keep up with orders mainly due to our legacy logistics platform. We heard about the benefits of containers and very much want to head in that direction. Can you help us get there? 

## Interstella GTC Workshops and Updates

This is a workshop series designed as a learning path starting with introductory Docker concepts to advanced container operations.  The workshops are based on [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) and [Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to help you get familiar with AWS container offerings.   

re:Invent featured a (4) part series: 

1. Learn How to Use Docker on AWS
2. Monolith to Microservices with Amazon ECS
3. CICD for Containers on AWS
4. Advanced Microservice Operations

We're still going through feedback and making design decisions how to best offer this curriculum to folks in 2018.  Stay tuned as we release more updates, which hopefully will include new features and functionality such as [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).  This page is the best place for up to date information about the series. 

Thanks as always for your support and interest.  If you have ideas for new modules or have requests/feedback, please send us a note!

## Github Details
#### Client Side Application Code
The Interstella app code is up on GitHub: [amazon-ecs-interstella-team GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecs-interstella-workshop).

#### Server Side Code
There are server side assets that we are running (e.g. SNS topic, S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB). This is one of the areas we will be working on in preparation for relaunching this workshop series in 2018; the plan is to offer an admin CloudFormation stack which will allow you to run these assets on your own. The server section within the GitHub repo linked above is a work in progress, stay tuned!

## Contact Us
If you have any questions on our workshops or if you have feedback/suggestions, email [aws-interstella-team@amazon.com](mailto:aws-interstella-team@amazon.com). We'll be joining the ECS community Slack group soon. Stay tuned.
