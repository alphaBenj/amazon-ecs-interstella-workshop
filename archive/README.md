The Interstella team has evolved the workshop based on participant feedback and new AWS services/features that have launched.  Older versions of the workshop can be found here and may not run properly due to changes made in the shared infrastructure.  The refreshed [microservices workshop](../workshop-microservices/) offers a better experience overall, so have a look and let us know what you think.

We would love to hear your feedback to make sure we're making the best decisions for our customers - <aws-interstella-team@amazon.com>

Thank you for your continued interest!
